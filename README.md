# Wicked Maze

Wicked Maze is an iPhone physics puzzle game I created on 2012 (no longer available on iTunes) The released version that was on iTunes is a 5-level demo. 

Explore huge levels, collect coins, and combat enemies as a bouncing ball. Uses your smartphone's accelerometer to move the ball around the maze.

The game utilizes several existing libraries:

* *Cocos2D for iOS. This library, in turn, uses OpenGL ES to render its graphics.*

* *Box2D, an open-source, rigidbody, 2d physics engine written in C++.*

* *SimpleAudioEngine, a simple 2-channel audio library for Cocos2D.*

Where there is example code from other sources, it is noted in each files' comments.

*Developed by:*

   * Albith R. Delgado: *game design, programming, sprites, sound effects.*

   * José Ríos-Reboyas: *music & sound effects.*
   
  *Note: some tile sprites have been taken from the Lucky Warp game.* 
  
  *This artwork was created by Pablo Pimentel.*
