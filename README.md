# Wicked Maze

This iPhone game was released in 2012 and is no longer available in the App Store. 

Escape a tower full of mazes by running, jumping and teleporting to each level's exit.

The game utilizes several existing libraries:

* *Cocos2D for iOS. This library, in turn, uses OpenGL ES to render its graphics.*

* *Box2D, an open-source, rigidbody, 2d physics engine written in C++.*

* *SimpleAudioEngine, a simple 2-channel audio library for Cocos2D.*

Where there is example code from other sources, it is noted in each files' comments.
